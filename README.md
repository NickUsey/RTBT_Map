# RTBT_Map
## The object of this prgram is track where all of the bus stops are in cambridge that go near the MIT campus. With some manipulation of code within the JavaScript file you can change the map to any location you desire and have track the bus route throughout that area. For future improvements to this page, I would like to provide a search bar where you can search for any city location in the United States and have it project a bus route between two points within a major city area.
